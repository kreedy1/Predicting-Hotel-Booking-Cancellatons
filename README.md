<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Data Wrangling: Techniques used to clean and preprocess the dataset including handling missing values outliers and categorical variables.
*   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights gained from visualizing and analyzing the dataset including distributions correlations and trends.
*   Preprocessing: Steps taken to prepare the data for modeling such as scaling encoding categorical variables and splitting into training and testing sets.
*   Modeling: Overview of the machine learning algorithms used for prediction such as Decision Trees Random Forests Logistic Regression XGBoost AdaBoost Gradient Boosting and k-Nearest Neighbors.
*   Evaluation: Metrics used to evaluate model performance such as accuracy precision recall F1-score and ROC-AUC.
*   Results: Summary of the predictive performance of each model and insights gained from the analysis.
